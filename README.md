# Uber Ride Demand Patterns in NYC – April 2014

Interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing ~565,000 Uber pickups in New York City (April 2014) to uncover peak times, locations, and business insights.

## Project Overview
**Question**: In a city where traffic never sleeps, are weekday evenings more intense? Does location play a hidden role?

**Key Insights**:
- Evening rush (5–8 PM) dominates weekdays, with highest single-hour peak on Wednesdays.
- Manhattan accounts for ~86% of rides (486K out of 565K).
- Weekend patterns are quieter and more spread out.
- Demand shows clear business opportunities for driver allocation and surge pricing.

**Tools Used**:
- Excel (data cleaning, derived columns)
- Power BI (interactive dashboard, maps, DAX measures)
- SQL (aggregations, ranking with window functions)
- Python (Pandas/Matplotlib for trend analysis)

## Dashboard Features
- Slicers for day of week
- KPI cards: Total Rides (565K), Avg Daily (18.82K), Max Hourly (~45K overall)
- Hourly pickups chart by day
- Geospatial map showing Manhattan dominance
